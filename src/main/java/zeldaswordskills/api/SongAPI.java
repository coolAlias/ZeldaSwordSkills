/**
 * 
 * Assortment of methods to facilitate interaction of custom {@link AbstractZeldaSong}
 * classes with the Zelda Sword Skills mod.
 * 
 * To add a new song:
 * 
 * 1. Create a class extending AbstractZeldaSong (or use an anonymous class during registration)
 * 
 * 2. Override {@link AbstractZeldaSong#getSoundString} to return your sound file
 * 		location (be sure to add the sound file and edit your sounds.JSON).
 * 
 * 3. Override the abstract method to perform whatever effect you want.
 * 
 * 4. Register a a new instance of your class during {@code FMLPreInitializationEvent}
 * 		using {@link SongAPI#registerSong}: SongAPI.registerSong(new YourSongClass(args));
 *
 *		If your song conflicted with any previously registered songs, warnings will be
 *		generated in the console log. Song names and notes must be sufficiently unique:
 *		- For names, it is advised to prepend them with a unique identifier, e.g. 'yourmodid.songname'
 *		- For notes, consider loading them from config to allow for future conflict resolution
 *
 *		If you need a reference to your song, create a separate reference class similar to Items:
 *			public class YourSongRefs {
 *				public static final AbstractZeldaSong yourSong = SongAPI.getSongByName("yoursongname");
 *			}
 * 
 * 5. Done. Now the player just has to learn it using one of the following methods:
 *		a. Use {@link SongAPI#openSongLearningGui} to open the song gui, learning it note by note
 *		b. Use {@link SongAPI#learnSong} to add a song directly to the player's known songs
 *		c. {@link BlockSongInscription} blocks can be set to teach specific songs, but must
 *			first be placed into the world and set to the correct song.
 *
 *		The first two methods can be used pretty much anywhere, e.g.
 *			{@link Item#onItemRightClick}, {@link Block#onBlockActivated}, Forge Events, etc.
 *
 *	Once a player has learned a song, they can play it using any {@link ItemInstrument}
 *
