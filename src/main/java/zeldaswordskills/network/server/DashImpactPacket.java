 * while using Dash, and calls {@link Dash#onImpact}, thereby handling and terminating
 * the server side instance of the skill.
 * 
 * This is a workaround for the server having difficulties detecting impacts, at least
 * from the viewpoint of the player; whereas the client impact detection reflects perfectly
 * what the user would expect based on what they see, the server fails to detect entity
 * collisions and usually collides with blocks that the player is standing on, which is
 * weird, considering it works fine for entities like arrows. Hm.
 * 
 * Also need to send the player's motionX and motionZ, as the server values are typically zero.
