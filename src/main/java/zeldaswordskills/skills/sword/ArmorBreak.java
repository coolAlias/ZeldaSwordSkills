/**
 * 
 * ARMOR BREAK
 * Description: Unleash a powerful blow that ignores armor
 * Activation: Hold attack for (20 - level) ticks
 * Effect: Unleashes an attack that inflicts normal weapon damage but ignores armor
 * Exhaustion: 2.0F - (0.1F * level)
 * Special: May only be used while locked on to a target
 * 			Charge time is reduced by 5 ticks when wielding a Master Sword
 * 
 * Using this skill performs an attack that ignores armor but otherwise deals exactly the
 * same damage as a normal attack with the given item would, including all bonuses from other
 * skills and enchantments.
 * 
 * Armor Break cannot be activated by normal means. It must be charged by holding the 'attack'
 * key, and once the charge reaches full, the player will perform the Armor Break attack.
 *

	 * crazy as long as the key is held, which is not very cool. For custom key bindings
	 * this is not an issue, as it only results in an attack when the key is first pressed.
	 * 
	 * Another issue: while mouse state is true, if the cursor moves over a block, the player
	 * will furiously swing his arm at it, as though trying to break it. Perhaps it is better
	 * to set the key state to false as before and track 'buttonstate' from within the skill,
	 * though in that case it needs to listen for key releases as well as presses.
	 * Note that this is the default vanilla behavior for holding down the attack key, so
	 * perhaps it is best to leave it as is.
